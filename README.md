## 📊 Data Model and Mock Data

* `src/types/pipeline.ts` → Candidate (stage, skills, interviewStatus, notes, etc.), JobOverview, PIPELINE_STAGES
* `src/types/filters.ts` → StageFilter, ExperienceFilter, ScoreFilter
* `src/data/mock-candidates.ts` → list of candidates distributed across stages
* `src/data/mock-job.ts` → active job overview data

👉 Filtering logic is implemented in:

```bash
src/lib/filter-candidates.ts
```

👉 Consumed by:

```bash
CandidatePipelineDashboard
```

> ⚠️ Note: This project uses static mock data for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with API-based data fetching.
